# til

Random tip for myself

# JS
- `null` and `undefined` are similar but behave slightly differently
```
 10 + null; // null behaves like zero
 << 10
 10 + undefined; // undefined is not a number
 << NaN
 ```
 
In general, values tend to be set to `undefined` by JavaScript, whereas values are usually set to `null` by the developer
